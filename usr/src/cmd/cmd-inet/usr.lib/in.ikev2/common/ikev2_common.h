/*
 * The SA payload is used to describe a host's policy (for both IKE traffic
 * and when creating IPsec SAs) to a peer.  RFC7296 2.7 has all the details,
 * but briefly, mechanisms are organized by type (ENCR, AUTH, PRF, etc) and
 * then grouped into proposals.  Depending on the type of SA being negotiated
 * (as indicated in the protocol field of the proposal), some types are
 * required, while others are mandatory.  For example, for an ESP SA,
 * a proposal MUST specify at least one encryption algorithm and if ESNs can
 * be used if that proposal is selected.  It can optionally include an
 * integrity (AUTH) mechanism if one should be used if this proposal is
 * selected.  A given proposal then loosely means 'any 1 of each type (ENCR,
 * AUTH, ...) from this list is acceptable.'
 *
 * When evaluating proposals, we track which types of mechanisms (transforms)
 * are present in our policy, which types are present in the peer's policy
 * we are currently evaluating, as well as which types have found a matching
 * value.  For a given type, the matching value is then saved in their
 * respective fields (ism_encr for the matching ENCR mechanism, etc.).  Since
 * not every transform type is used with a given SA type, this allows us to
 * make sure we have a match for every type either we or our peer has proposed.
 *
 * For convenience, when negotiating IKE SAs, we also include the authentication
 * method (preshared, RSA sig, etc.) from the matching local policy as well as
 * the IKE lifetime from the matching local policy.  These are not negotiated
 * in IKEv2 (i.e. there is no choosing by the responder, each side just uses
 * whatever is in their local configuration), and are ignored when performing
 * non-IKE evaluations.
